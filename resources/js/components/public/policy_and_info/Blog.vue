                >
                  Let’s go to the flashback, It was 1999 when the first e-commerce company
                  comes in Bangladesh And Munshiji.com is the first e-commerce company in
                  bangladesh. that was not too much easy to start online shopping business
                  in bangladesh . It was not welcomed in Bangladesh at the beginning
                  stage. And Due to politics, slow internet, and poverty of our country
                  and others so many problems they stop their business in bd. After that
                  many companies have tried so many times but could not see the bright
                  sun. Though many people don’t know about Munshiji.com but they know
                  about ekhanei.com is first online shop in bangladesh. So,let’s discuss
                  when bangladeshi people started to know about online shopping . It was
                  2006 when ekhanei.com officially published by grameenphone and at the
                  same time they open cellbazar. And for the first time, It was a
                  successful project. And it’s open the eye of the investor. And many
                  investors inspire from them. And If we go to the flashback then we find
                  that It was the turning point to open the eye of investor and highly
                  inspire others to come in this sector. And after that Here comes Bikroy
                  and totally change the mind setup and widely give a good sound to people
                  to engage with the online marketplace. Though online shopping in
                  Bangladesh was not popular and not welcomed at the beginning stage it’s
                  come with many upwards and downwards in bd. And took about one and a
                  half decades to get success to come to today’s stage. And now many
                  companies like ajkerdeal,daraj and gearboost are come to the stage and
                  make easier shopping for people. 2. 10 reason for online shopping in
                  bangladesh Though there are so many reason to do online shopping in
                  bangladesh.But I will show you most 10 important reason that attract you
                  to do online shopping at bangladesh. So,let’s start : 1. Unbearable
                  Traffic Jam : If you live in Dhaka city then you will agree with me
                  that, the traffic jam of Dhaka city is totally out of control from you.
                  Because the road of Dhaka city is limited and many times VIP person go
                  on the road. And then start non-stop traffic. If your time is so much
                  important and you want to save your valuable time and not want the
                  hassle of traffic jam then online shopping is the best alternative
                  solution for you. 2. Get rid of product price bargains : If you have
                  experience of shopping in Dhaka city or anywhere of Bangladesh then you
                  will appreciate with me that, If you want to buy products from shopping
                  mall and not want to be foolish then you must bargain about product
                  price with the shopkeeper. Because, If you visit then you see the
                  majority of shopping mall in Bangladesh, the product price is not fixed.
                  And If you are a new customer then the shopkeeper will try to make you
                  foolish. And want to take two multiple prices to you from the real
                  price. So, If you buy products from online then you don’t need to
                  bargains with the shopkeeper.because the price of online products are
                  fixed. 3. Get rid of shopkeeper Bad behaviour : Though maximum
                  shopkeeper behavior is good. But there are some shopkeeper who will show
                  a bad attitude to you if you pricing the product but not buy from him
                  with any reason. An example, at new market in Dhaka there is a market
                  called Chandrima super market. Here a lady was hassled with language by
                  the shopkeeper. And then the police arrest the shopkeeper. And that news
                  came in many newspapers at that time. You may check.
                </p>

                <p
                  style="
                    text-align: justify;
                    line-height: 28px;
                    padding: 5px;
                    font-size: 16px;
                    margin-top: 30px;
                  "
                >
                  So, If you do your shopping online then you have not any risk or tension
                  about this matter.because in online shopping system you will not connect
                  with shopkeeper directly. And if you have any complaint about the
                  products or shopkeeper then you can do it with your website helpline
                  where you buy the products. And then they will take action on the
                  shopkeeper. 4. Product refund : If you buy a product from any physical
                  shopping mall and then if any product has any problem but the shopkeeper
                  hide it to you and you found that after come into your house then what
                  will you do? Obviously, you must go back to shopkeeper.but most of the
                  cases if the shopkeeper is not an honest person, he will not refund your
                  product anymore. And will say you, why not you see that before buying.
                  And they not refund product after buy. Though there have some shop who
                  have 7 or 10 or 15days refund policy. but the majority have not yet. On
                  the other hand, if you buy products from online and find the problem of
                  products or the products is not the same as you saw then you will get
                  chances to refund it with 3days. And almost every online shopping
                  company have the refund policy. 5. Varieties of price waste your Time :
                  Suppose you want to buy a shirt or dress and one shopkeeper tell you the
                  price is $15 and other says it $10. But the shirt color is the same but
                  you think the Cloth Threads are different. Or you buy a shirt or dress
                  and visit too many shops and getting confused about what should buy or
                  what not! And it’s really wastage of many people including me also in
                  the psychical shop. So, If you won't get rid of confusion and save your
                  time then online shopping in Bangladesh is the best option for you.
                  6.All of your products in one shop : Do you want to buy a t-shirt, a
                  watch, a cricket bat and also a frying pan?If yes, and from psychical
                  shopping mall then you must go to four shops. And you find one is market
                  ‘A’ and other is marke ‘B’ and others are market ‘C’ then what will you
                  do? You must go everywhere if you want to buy. But in the online
                  shopping at Bangladesh you don’t need to go to many shops.You will get
                  all of your products in one place, just add to cart your every product
                  and buy it in one click. And it will save you many times and make simple
                  to your life 7.The risk of political strike : Suppose you are ready for
                  your shopping and comes in the road from your house and see that today
                  is one kind of strike and the busses are stopped for this. And you can’t
                  go there or go to the market with extra bus fare and risk. And also it
                  wastes your many valuable time. On the other hand, if you buy your
                  products from online shopping of Bangladesh then you don’t take any
                  headache about this. 8.Is market close or Open : If you live in the
                  Dhaka city or anywhere in Bangladesh then you know that every market has
                  a specific different holiday.

                  "
                >
                  An example Eastern Plaza, Bashundhara City, New Market are closed on
                  Tuesday but mirpur 1 market closed in Thursday and Mirpur 10 or IDB of
                  agargaon are closed in Sunday. So, If you target one market and go on
                  there on the closed days and you will get back with Bare hands and waste
                  your money and time. Besides, The online shopping of Bangladesh Are open
                  for you 24hours of a day 7days of a weak and 365days of a year. When
                  your mind wants,what your mind want you can check the price of the
                  product and buy it in your preferred time. So, you are welcome in the
                  online shopping to Bangladesh. 9.Payment system and safety :If you don’t
                  have any car. You always going shopping without your personal vehicle, I
                  think the majority of us have not a personal car yet. Then you have a
                  risk of loss of your money bag or handset on the bus or other vehicles
                  in Dhaka city. And if you looked that the online shopping Bangladesh
                  system then you will find that, if you buy a product then you can pay it
                  from your mobile bank account or cash on delivery(that means pay after
                  getting your product). Where you have not to go anywhere and not have
                  any risk. You can pay with full of your safety. 10.online shopping in

                <p
                  style="
                    text-align: justify;
                    line-height: 28px;
                    padding: 5px;
                    font-size: 16px;
                    margin-top: 30px;
                  "
                >
                  Then you need online payment.otherwise, you can buy any products with
                  cash on delivery. ? Cash on delivery : It’s a very interesting system
                  and the most popular system of online shopping in bangladesh or allover
                  in the world. And It’s a very simple and easy system The system is the
                  product come to your house with a delivery man and you check is it all
                  right as you saw then you pay to the delivery man. 4.The source of
                  eCommerce Product in Bangladesh : There was a time when the market was
                  in a low competition and then our majority products of online shopping
                  were from China .But now the time is change ,many local clients focus
                  their business in online shopping.Though lots of products still from
                  China. But for this reason of client competition now, many local
                  products come on online shopping in bangladesh. Like :online shopping
                  bangladesh dress online shopping bangladesh clothes,bd fashion online
                  and etc. And many other products you can find in Bangladesh now. So, You
                  are welcome in online shopping bangladesh. 5. The major problem of
                  online shopping : I think there is no service in the world without any
                  kinds of problem. And for the first of any service, there should be some
                  problem. And bangladesh is not out from those rules. And there has some
                  problem also. ? Product not delivery on right time: This is the most
                  common complaint of customer or almost 70-80% of the customer complaint
                  about this that the products deliver with delay 2-3 days or 7days delay
                  from their given timing. ? Real time tracking system : In bangladesh, No
                  e-commerce company still not start any real time tracking system where
                  the customer could ensure where their product is now? and how it is? Is
                  there any problem happened with my product? why so late ? all of the
                  questions could be answered if the real time tracking system open. And I
                  think it will open very soon . And it will be more popular. ? Wrong
                  product delivery : Sometimes by mistake, they deliver Wrong product to
                  the customer for their wrong packing and then customer get angry on them
                  and refund the products. And if the customer needs the product then he
                  again re-order to deliver the product. And It’s waste and gives a hassle
                  to the customer. ? Wrong address or information:Either some bad customer
                  to take an act of revenge or want to give some hassle to the delivery
                  man they don’t pick up their phone on product delivery time or when the
                  delivery man would go his house or neither given a wrong address to
                  delivery address. And for some that reason, the online shop got some
                  strict and not want to deliver with only a product. They deliver product
                  in one area with many customers.so that, if one or two customers given
                  wrong information but the maximum product will deliver on the right time
                  . And if we want to understand that , It’s also a reason for late
                  delivery of our product. 6.The safety of online shopping : It’s can be a

                  If it’s on https:// or there have a locked button on there. Or if it
                  without https version that means you do not properly save with your
                  data. It can be a risk for you. So, I highly recommend you not to buy
                  anything without SSL or https:// version site. So, keep safe with your
                  account and stay happy with online shopping. 7.Top e-commerce sites of
