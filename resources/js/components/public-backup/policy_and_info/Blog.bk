              Bangladesh So why you are waiting , let’s start: 1. History of
              Online shopping in Bangladesh : Everyone know online shopping is
              many popular in a country like USA,UK or any other European
              country. And they start their e-commerce journey many before. But
              it’s should be a question to your minds or many others, How and
              when e-commerce or online shopping comes in Bangladesh ? Which is
              the first e-commerce company in Bangladesh ? are they still alive
              or not? OK! I am breaking your curiosity.</p> 
              
              <p style="text-align: justify;line-height:28px;padding:5px;font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;" > Let’s go to the
              flashback, It was 1999 when the first e-commerce company comes in
              Bangladesh And Munshiji.com is the first e-commerce company in
              bangladesh. that was not too much easy to start online shopping
              business in bangladesh . It was not welcomed in Bangladesh at the
              beginning stage. And Due to politics, slow internet, and poverty
              of our country and others so many problems they stop their
              business in bd. After that many companies have tried so many times
              but could not see the bright sun. Though many people don’t know
              about Munshiji.com but they know about ekhanei.com is first online
              shop in bangladesh. So,let’s discuss when bangladeshi people
              started to know about online shopping . It was 2006 when
              ekhanei.com officially published by grameenphone and at the same
              time they open cellbazar. And for the first time, It was a
              successful project. And it’s open the eye of the investor. And
              many investors inspire from them. And If we go to the flashback
              then we find that It was the turning point to open the eye of
              investor and highly inspire others to come in this sector. And
              after that Here comes Bikroy and totally change the mind setup and
              widely give a good sound to people to engage with the online
              marketplace. Though online shopping in Bangladesh was not popular
              and not welcomed at the beginning stage it’s come with many
              upwards and downwards in bd. And took about one and a half decades
              to get success to come to today’s stage. And now many companies
              like ajkerdeal,daraj and gearboost are come to the stage and make
              easier shopping for people. 2. 10 reason for online shopping in
              bangladesh Though there are so many reason to do online shopping
              in bangladesh.But I will show you most 10 important reason that
              attract you to do online shopping at bangladesh. So,let’s start :
              1. Unbearable Traffic Jam : If you live in Dhaka city then you
              will agree with me that, the traffic jam of Dhaka city is totally
              out of control from you. Because the road of Dhaka city is limited
              and many times VIP person go on the road. And then start non-stop
              traffic. If your time is so much important and you want to save
              your valuable time and not want the hassle of traffic jam then
              online shopping is the best alternative solution for you. 2. Get
              rid of product price bargains : If you have experience of shopping
              in Dhaka city or anywhere of Bangladesh then you will appreciate
              with me that, If you want to buy products from shopping mall and
              not want to be foolish then you must bargain about product price
              with the shopkeeper. Because, If you visit then you see the
              majority of shopping mall in Bangladesh, the product price is not
              fixed. And If you are a new customer then the shopkeeper will try
              to make you foolish. And want to take two multiple prices to you
              from the real price. So, If you buy products from online then you
              don’t need to bargains with the shopkeeper.because the price of
              online products are fixed. 3. Get rid of shopkeeper Bad behaviour
              : Though maximum shopkeeper behavior is good. But there are some
              shopkeeper who will show a bad attitude to you if you pricing the
              product but not buy from him with any reason. An example, at new
              market in Dhaka there is a market called Chandrima super market.
              Here a lady was hassled with language by the shopkeeper. And then
              the police arrest the shopkeeper. And that news came in many
              newspapers at that time. You may check. </p>
              
             <p style="text-align: justify;line-height:28px;padding:5px;font-size:16px;margin-top:30px;" > 
              So, If you do your
              shopping online then you have not any risk or tension about this
              matter.because in online shopping system you will not connect with
              shopkeeper directly. And if you have any complaint about the
              products or shopkeeper then you can do it with your website
              helpline where you buy the products. And then they will take
              action on the shopkeeper. 4. Product refund : If you buy a product
              from any physical shopping mall and then if any product has any
              problem but the shopkeeper hide it to you and you found that after
              come into your house then what will you do? Obviously, you must go
              back to shopkeeper.but most of the cases if the shopkeeper is not
              an honest person, he will not refund your product anymore. And
              will say you, why not you see that before buying. And they not
              refund product after buy. Though there have some shop who have 7
              or 10 or 15days refund policy. but the majority have not yet. On
              the other hand, if you buy products from online and find the
              problem of products or the products is not the same as you saw
              then you will get chances to refund it with 3days. And almost
              every online shopping company have the refund policy. 5. Varieties
              of price waste your Time : Suppose you want to buy a shirt or
              dress and one shopkeeper tell you the price is $15 and other says
              it $10. But the shirt color is the same but you think the Cloth
              Threads are different. Or you buy a shirt or dress and visit too
              many shops and getting confused about what should buy or what not!
              And it’s really wastage of many people including me also in the
              psychical shop. So, If you won't get rid of confusion and save
              your time then online shopping in Bangladesh is the best option
              for you. 6.All of your products in one shop : Do you want to buy a
              t-shirt, a watch, a cricket bat and also a frying pan?If yes, and
              from psychical shopping mall then you must go to four shops. And
              you find one is market ‘A’ and other is marke ‘B’ and others are
              market ‘C’ then what will you do? You must go everywhere if you
              want to buy. But in the online shopping at Bangladesh you don’t
              need to go to many shops.You will get all of your products in one
              place, just add to cart your every product and buy it in one
              click. And it will save you many times and make simple to your
              life 7.The risk of political strike : Suppose you are ready for
              your shopping and comes in the road from your house and see that
              today is one kind of strike and the busses are stopped for this.
              And you can’t go there or go to the market with extra bus fare and
              risk. And also it wastes your many valuable time. On the other
              hand, if you buy your products from online shopping of Bangladesh
              then you don’t take any headache about this. 8.Is market close or
              Open : If you live in the Dhaka city or anywhere in Bangladesh
              then you know that every market has a specific different holiday. </p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;line-height:28px;padding:5px;font-size:16px;margin-top:30px;" > 
              An example Eastern Plaza, Bashundhara City, New Market are closed
              on Tuesday but mirpur 1 market closed in Thursday and Mirpur 10 or
              IDB of agargaon are closed in Sunday. So, If you target one market
              and go on there on the closed days and you will get back with Bare
              hands and waste your money and time. Besides, The online shopping
              of Bangladesh Are open for you 24hours of a day 7days of a weak
              and 365days of a year. When your mind wants,what your mind want
              you can check the price of the product and buy it in your
              preferred time. So, you are welcome in the online shopping to
              Bangladesh. 9.Payment system and safety :If you don’t have any
              car. You always going shopping without your personal vehicle, I
              think the majority of us have not a personal car yet. Then you
              have a risk of loss of your money bag or handset on the bus or
              other vehicles in Dhaka city. And if you looked that the online
              shopping Bangladesh system then you will find that, if you buy a
              product then you can pay it from your mobile bank account or cash
              on delivery(that means pay after getting your product). Where you
              have not to go anywhere and not have any risk. You can pay with
              full of your safety. 10.online shopping in bangladesh with home

              <p style="text-align: justify;line-height:28px;padding:5px;font-size:16px;margin-top:30px;" > 
              Then you need online payment.otherwise, you can
              buy any products with cash on delivery. ? Cash on delivery : It’s
              a very interesting system and the most popular system of online
              shopping in bangladesh or allover in the world. And It’s a very
              simple and easy system The system is the product come to your
              house with a delivery man and you check is it all right as you saw
              then you pay to the delivery man. 4.The source of eCommerce
              Product in Bangladesh : There was a time when the market was in a
              low competition and then our majority products of online shopping
              were from China .But now the time is change ,many local clients
              focus their business in online shopping.Though lots of products
              still from China. But for this reason of client competition now,
              many local products come on online shopping in bangladesh. Like
              :online shopping bangladesh dress online shopping bangladesh
              clothes,bd fashion online and etc. And many other products you can
              find in Bangladesh now. So, You are welcome in online shopping
              bangladesh. 5. The major problem of online shopping : I think
              there is no service in the world without any kinds of problem. And
              for the first of any service, there should be some problem. And
              bangladesh is not out from those rules. And there has some problem
              also. ? Product not delivery on right time: This is the most
              common complaint of customer or almost 70-80% of the customer
              complaint about this that the products deliver with delay 2-3 days
              or 7days delay from their given timing. ? Real time tracking
              system : In bangladesh, No e-commerce company still not start any
              real time tracking system where the customer could ensure where
              their product is now? and how it is? Is there any problem happened
              with my product? why so late ? all of the questions could be
              answered if the real time tracking system open. And I think it
              will open very soon . And it will be more popular. ? Wrong product
              delivery : Sometimes by mistake, they deliver Wrong product to the
              customer for their wrong packing and then customer get angry on
              them and refund the products. And if the customer needs the
              product then he again re-order to deliver the product. And It’s
              waste and gives a hassle to the customer. ? Wrong address or
              information:Either some bad customer to take an act of revenge or
              want to give some hassle to the delivery man they don’t pick up
              their phone on product delivery time or when the delivery man
              would go his house or neither given a wrong address to delivery
              address. And for some that reason, the online shop got some strict
              and not want to deliver with only a product. They deliver product
              in one area with many customers.so that, if one or two customers
              given wrong information but the maximum product will deliver on
              the right time . And if we want to understand that , It’s also a
              reason for late delivery of our product. 6.The safety of online
              shopping : It’s can be a question to your mind . Am I safe with
              online shopping ? Is my data secure ? or my online payment or
              bkash/rocket in a risk ? In the modern hacking world it’s not
              impossible if you not aware of this. And the safety of your
              accounts is on your hand. You can ask me how ? Yes now, I tell you
              how can safe with that just simply follow only 1 rule. And that is
              , when buying any online shop then just check that their website
              have https:// version or not. </p>
              
              
              <p style="text-align: justify;line-height:28px;padding:5px;font-size:16px;margin-top:30px;" > 
              If it’s on https:// or there have a
              locked button on there. Or if it without https version that means
              you do not properly save with your data. It can be a risk for you.
              So, I highly recommend you not to buy anything without SSL or
              https:// version site. So, keep safe with your account and stay
              happy with online shopping. 7.Top e-commerce sites of Bangladesh:
              In some recent years there are many entrepreneurs want or try to
              come in this field and the marker is going competitive. With some
              big company like daraj,ajker deal there are also some new company
              whose are trying to give their best service to hold the market.
              With market analysis, I will give you a list of the Best 10
              e-commerce site list. The list could be changed with google
              ranking or with customer satisfaction or some company service. Or
              there could be a revolution with any new company. Just like
              facebook . No one imagines about this that, there some company can
              come and compete with google or Microsoft. And according to some
              source, It’s hearing that Amazon and aliexpress will come in
              bangladesh and then the market will be more competitive . And then
              everyone service will be more good to stay on the market. ?
              AjkerDeal.com ? Daraj.com, ? Priyoshop.com ? Kaymu.com.bd ?
              Bagdoom.com ? Chaldal.com ? Branoo.com ? Othoba.com ? BDSHOP.com ?
              Aarong.com In the above list can be changed by their service or
              can be joined by a big company. An example daraj include with
              Alibaba in bangladesh. So, If amazon or the biggest company like
              Ali express,e-bay comes in bangladesh and Ajker deal or any
              company add with them and start a joint venture company that not
              be a surprisable matter And some new chanel said that, Amazon will
              come in 2020 for invest in bangladesh. And this also a good thing
              that our local biggest players are the focus on there and come on
